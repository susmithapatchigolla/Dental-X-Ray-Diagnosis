# Dental X Ray Diagnosis using Deep Neural Networks

Artificial intelligence, Deep learning algorithms have captivated the healthcare industry as these innovative analytics strategies become more accurate and applicable to a variety of tasks. In the field of Medical Sciences, we have large scope for data science applications in dentistry.  Dental X-rays (radiographs) are images of teeth that dentist uses to evaluate the oral health. This can help your dentist to identify problems like cavities, tooth decay, and impacted teeth. As it is becoming a hectic work for the dentists to check these radiographs and tell the result, we came up with a deep learning model which identifies and predict the diseases like jaw disorders, cysts, tumours etc. and makes it easier and faster for the dentists. It predicts the dental diseases by scanning the Radiographs, enabling the dentists   to do the treatment fastly. This model includes an automatic method with the medical knowledge, the images are fed as input to the deep learning model. After the training is over for all the dental related diseases, we then use it for testing purpose which predicts dental diseases.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
